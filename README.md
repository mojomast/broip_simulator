# BROIP Simulator

## Overview

BROIP (Bong Rip Over IP Protocol) Simulator is a satirical terminal-based application that simulates a fictional networking protocol for transmitting "bong rips" over the internet. This project is a humorous take on networking protocols, presented as an interactive terminal UI built with React Ink.

## Description

The BROIP Simulator is a tongue-in-cheek application that mimics a sophisticated network protocol for sharing virtual "bong rips" across digital infrastructure. The application features a comprehensive terminal UI with various modules that simulate different aspects of this fictional protocol, including:

- Chamber Control (Send Rip)
- Percolation Monitor
- Crystal Analysis
- Diffusion Config
- Bowl Status
- Dab Market
- Friends List
- Route Planner
- Achievements
- Sensory Experience
- Neural Singularity Ripping
- RIP-API
- Decentralized Ledger
- Legal Mode
- Auto-Carb
- Settings

## Technology Stack

- TypeScript
- React
- Ink (Terminal UI framework for React)
- Node.js
