# BROIP Simulator: Bong Rip Over IP Protocol

> "The future of smoking is not local—it's distributed." 🌿💨

## What is BROIP?

BROIP (Bong Rip Over IP Protocol) Simulator is a satirical terminal-based application that simulates a fictional networking protocol for transmitting "bong rips" over the internet. This project is a humorous take on networking protocols, tech buzzwords, and startup culture, presented as an interactive terminal UI built with React Ink.

## Core Features

- **💨 Chamber Control (Send Rip)**: Simulate the initiation of a virtual bong rip
- **📊 Percolation Monitor**: Track the efficiency of your virtual percolation system
- **💎 Crystal Analysis**: Analyze the fictional terpene profiles of your virtual strains
- **🔍 Diffusion Config**: Configure how your virtual smoke disperses through the network
- **🍃 Bowl Status**: Monitor the status of your virtual bowl
- **💰 Dab Market**: Explore a fictional marketplace for virtual concentrates
- **👥 Friends List**: Manage your virtual smoking buddies
- **🗺️ Route Planner**: Plan and optimize routes for transmitting "rips" across the network
- **🏆 Achievements**: Unlock virtual achievements as you explore the simulator
- **✨ Sensory Experience**: Simulate the sensory aspects of the fictional protocol
- **🧠 Neural Singularity Ripping**: Experience the cutting-edge of fictional rip technology
- **💻 RIP-API**: Explore the developer platform for the fictional protocol
- **⛓️ Decentralized Ledger**: Track your rips on a fictional blockchain
- **⚖️ Legal Mode**: Enable stealth mode for your virtual sessions
- **🤖 Auto-Carb**: Let AI manage your virtual carb cap

## The BROIP Protocol Evolution

The BROIP protocol has "evolved" through several fictional versions, each more absurd than the last:

- **v0.1.0 (Pre-Alpha)**: Basic protocol with Rip Initiator, Rip Receiver, and Series of Tubes
- **v0.2.0 (Hazy Vision)**: Added blockchain, AI, and monetization strategies
- **v3.0 (Cosmic Chronic)**: Introduced multiverse rip sync and sentient BongOS
- **v4.0 (The Final Puff)**: Features neural singularity ripping and black hole compression
- **v5.0 (The Infinite Blaze)**: Includes neural cloud smoking and celebrity AI co-pilots
- **WEED 2.0 (DLC)**: The fictional "sequel to cannabis" with infinite strain engine

## Technology Stack

- TypeScript
- React
- Ink (Terminal UI framework for React)
- Node.js

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/broipsimulator.git
   cd broipsimulator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd broip-cli
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the application:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Development

To run the application in development mode:

```
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

- `broip-cli/`: Main application directory
  - `src/`: Source code
    - `components/`: React components for different modules
    - `utils/`: Utility functions and types
  - `dist/`: Compiled JavaScript files
  - `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts

## Technical Specifications

The BROIP protocol is documented in several specification files in the root directory:

- `plan.broip`: The original technical specification with core architecture and features
- `plan2.broip`: Introduces blockchain, AI, and monetization strategies
- `plan3.broip`: Details multiverse rip sync and sentient BongOS
- `plan4.broip`: Outlines neural singularity ripping and black hole compression
- `plan5.broip`: Describes neural cloud smoking and celebrity AI co-pilots
- `weed2.broip`: The fictional "sequel to cannabis" with infinite strain engine

## Development Status

**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This project is in active development, and the developer has no idea what the hell he is doing. Most of the features described in the documentation are probably not implemented yet (or ever). The protocol specifications get progressively more absurd with each version, and that's entirely the point.

Proceed with low expectations, a sense of humor, and the understanding that this is a satirical project meant to poke fun at tech buzzwords, startup culture, and over-engineered solutions.
